## Installation

```sh
npx @benmvp/cli create my-awesome-lib
```

Installs the latest version of `@benmvp/cli` as a dev dependency and updates the `package.json` as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-lib",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "benmvp start",
    "test": "benmvp test",
    "build": "benmvp build"
  }
}
```

Read the API docs for more on [`benmvp create`](API.md#benmvp-create).

## Quick Usage

### Testing

```sh
yarn test
```

In your continuous integration (CI) environment, run `yarn test` (or `npm test`) to do a one-time pass of Typescript typings, ESLint linting, and Jest tests. This can also be run locally (i.e. for commit hooks).

Read the API docs for more on [`benmvp test`](API.md#benmvp-test).

### Developing

```sh
yarn start
```

When developing, run `yarn start` (or `npm start`) which will validate Typescript typings, ESLint linting, and Jest tests as you develop and change code.

Read the API docs for more on [`benmvp start`](API.md#benmvp-start).

### Building

```sh
yarn build
```

In your continuous integration (CI) environment, run `yarn build` (or `npm build`) to generated transpiled versions of your code in ESM (ECMAScript module), UMD (Unified module definition) & web formats.

Read the API docs for more on [`benmvp build`](API.md#benmvp-build).
